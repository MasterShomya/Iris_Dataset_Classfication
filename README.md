# Iris_Dataset_Classfication

This repository contains a Logistic Regression model for classifying the Iris dataset. The model predicts the species of an Iris flower based on its petal & sepal measurements.

## Dataset
- **File:** `iris.csv`
- **Source:** The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset in machine learning inbuilt of Sci-kit learn library, containing 150 samples of Iris flowers with four features:
  - Sepal Length
  - Sepal Width
  - Petal Length
  - Petal Width
  - Species (target variable)

## Project Overview
- **Algorithm:** Logistic Regression
- **Implementation:** Jupyter Notebook (`iris-logistic-regression.ipynb`)
- **Libraries Used:**
  - NumPy
  - Pandas
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn
  - Scikit-Learn

## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MasterShomya/Iris_Dataset_Classification.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd Iris_Dataset_Classification
   ```

3. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Open Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Usage
- Run all the cells in `iris-logistic-regression.ipynb` to train and evaluate the model.
- The notebook includes data visualization, preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation.

## Results
- The logistic regression model achieves good accuracy in classifying Iris species.
- Visualizations such as scatter plots and confusion matrices help understand model performance.

## Future Improvements
- Experiment with different machine learning models (e.g., Decision Trees, SVM, Neural Networks).
- Implement feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning.
- Deploy the model as a web application.
